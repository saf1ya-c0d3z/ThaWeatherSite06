In this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, DAYJS and Jquery to create and style a Weather website that will retrieve the weather for the current day and show a forecast for the next five days using API call's and Local Storage. The user can search any city and a fetch using an API, the latitude,longitude and the city name to find specific weather details for the city the user desires a forecast for..  I considered fucntionality of links, efficiency in code and using HTML, beauty of CSS and efficiency of JavaScript properties to make the most efficent and functional website.
